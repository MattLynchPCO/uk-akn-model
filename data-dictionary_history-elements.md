# History annotations

AKN has a rich set of history annotations but, with the exception of
Stage 2 and Stage 3 as amended documents which are change-tracked
documents (sidelining only, not even in-line change-tracking) which
currently do not reference the amendment which created the change.
Therefore for now we will only be providing change-tracking and not
annotations. We leave the management of amendment history for
consolidated legislation to TNA when they apply the amendments in their
publishing system.
