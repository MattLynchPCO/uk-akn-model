# Inline elements

<span class="underline">TODO need to list these and how they are used
including</span>

  - document metadata from //preface etc
      - //docProponent
      - //docIntroducer
      - //docTitle
      - etc
  - direct formatting:
      - //b
      - //i
      - //u (currently not used)
  - reference markup (see page on references)
  - use of the generic //inline element (should use @name):
      - @name="AppendText"
      - any others?
