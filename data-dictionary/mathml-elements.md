## Mathematical Formulas

Lawmaker users MathML to represent mathematical formulas.

Mathematical formulas (not to be confused with the AKN //formula
element) appearing within legislation will appear within a
//tblock\[@class="formula"\]/foreign wrapper using the MathML Namespace
with the top element containing the //math element and MathML Namespace
declaration. While we don't specifically require MathML 3.0 support,
elements not shared between MathML 2.0 and MathML 3.0 (including both
new and deprecated elements) should be avoided.

Either presentation or content markup can be used although the two
should not be mixed in a single formula. 

The MathML standard is documented at [MathML 3.0
Standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/MathML3/)
