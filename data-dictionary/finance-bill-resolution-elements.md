## Finance Resolutions

Finance Resolutions, which are prepared as part of the process of drafting a UK Finance Bill and are contained in a Finance Bill Resolution Book, are each modelled as section-type element using `<hcontainer name="resolution">`

These typically contain a number
(//num) and heading (//heading) followed by an //intro with the main
content of the resolution, optionally follwed by subsections
(//subsection) or paragraphs (//level), then followed by a //wrapUp
which contains the boilerplate text "And it is declared that it is
expedient in the public interest that this Resolution should have
statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of
Taxes Act 1968."

See [Oasis AKN documentation for
//hcontainer](https://docs.oasis-open.org/legaldocml/akn-core/v1.0/os/part2-specs/os-part2-specs_xsd_Element_hcontainer.html)
