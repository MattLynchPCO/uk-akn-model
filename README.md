# Introduction

This documentation describes the Lawmaker data model. Lawmaker uses XML compliant with the [Akoma Ntoso](http://www.akomantoso.org/)
(AKN) schema with some limited extensions. 

This documentation includes:

  - [General principles and naming conventions](general-principles.md)
  - [Description of the LDAPP Schemas](schema-description.md)
  - [Lawmaker extensions to Akoma Ntoso](ldapp-extensions.md)
  - [@class values and their role](type.md)
  - [Element ID Scheme](id-scheme.md)
  - [Lawmaker Element Dictionary](data-dictionary.md)

## Background
The origin of this documentation is the [prototype Element Catalog](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15YY9VpiqCyZ9PsqdoNts-NKg5v4goxfTWuaP2zxfNXQ/edit#gid=1496705114)

It was originally created as a dokuwiki site but then converted to markdown using https://alldocs.app/convert-dokuwiki-to-markdown.

For alternative approaches, see [general information about extending and restricting Akoma Ntoso](https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/legaldocml/201512/msg00004/Extending_Akoma_Ntoso.pdf).
