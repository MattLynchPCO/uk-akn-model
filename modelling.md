\======= LDAPP Modelling =======

# Introduction

This document describes the LDAPP data model. The basic presumption is
that LDAPP XML is based on [Akoma Ntoso](http://www.akomantoso.org/)
(AKN) with some extensions and some restrictions. See also [general
information about extending and restricting Akoma
Ntoso](https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/legaldocml/201512/msg00004/Extending_Akoma_Ntoso.pdf).

The starting point is the [prototype Element
Catalog](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15YY9VpiqCyZ9PsqdoNts-NKg5v4goxfTWuaP2zxfNXQ/edit#gid=1496705114)
which will become the [LDAPP Data Dictionary](data-dictionary).

  - [Introduction](modelling)
  - [Guiding principles](principles)
  - [Description of the LDAPP Schemas](schema-description)
  - [LDAPP extensions to Akoma Ntoso](ldapp-extensions)
  - [Element and attribute naming conventions](naming-conventions)
  - [@class values and their role](type)
